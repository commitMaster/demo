        <p><strong>Models</strong> are the heart of any JavaScript application, containing the interactive data as well as a large part of the logic surrounding it: conversions, validations, computed properties, and access control. You extend Backbone.Model with your domain-specific methods, and Model provides a basic set of functionality for managing changes.</p>
    </script>

    <script type="text/template" id="addProduct">
        <p><strong>Backbone views</strong> are almost more convention than they are code - they don't determine anything about your HTML or CSS for you, and can be used with any JavaScript templating library. The general idea is to organize your interface into logical views, backed by models, each of which can be updated independently when the model changes, without having to redraw the page. Instead of digging into a JSON object, looking up an element in the DOM, and updating the HTML by hand, you can bind your view's render function to the model's "change" event - and now everywhere that model data is displayed in the UI, it is always immediately up to date.</p>
    </script>

    <script type="text/template" id="editProduct">
        <strong>Collections</strong> are ordered sets of models. You can bind "change" events to be notified when any model in the collection has been modified, listen for "add" and "remove" events, fetch the collection from the server, and use a full suite of Underscore.js methods.
